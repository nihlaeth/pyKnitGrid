pyKnitGrid
==========

Create to-scale png grids for designing knitting patterns.

Usage
==========

Inside this directory, type:
	python pyKnitGrid.py

Now simply answer the questions. It doesn't matter which unit
you use for your measurements (cm or inch), as long as you use
the same one for every question. The script will create a png
image inside the directory that you can edit with an image 
editing program (the background is transparent so you can put
a picture underneath and color the grid in accordingly) or you
can print it and color by hand.

Support
===========

If you have a problem with the script, you can open a ticket
at github.com/nihlaeth/pyKnitGrid
